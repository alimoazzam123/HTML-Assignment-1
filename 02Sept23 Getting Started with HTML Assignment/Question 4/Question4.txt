  =>HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. 
    Each HTML tags have different properties.
  =>All HTML tags must enclosed within < > these brackets.If you have used an 
    open tag <tag>, then you must use a close tag </tag> (except some tags)
  =>syntax:-<tag> content </tag> 
  =>example:-<p> Paragraph Tag </p>

    web pages and define content in that webpage. An element in HTML usually consist 
    of a start tag <tag name>, close tag </tag name> and content inserted between them.
  =>Technically, an element is a collection of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them.
