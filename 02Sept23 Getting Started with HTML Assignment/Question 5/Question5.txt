Q5 What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML"?
solution:-
  =>HTML <!DOCTYPE> tag is used to inform the browser about the 
    version of HTML used in the document. It is called as the 
    document type declaration (DTD).
  =>Technically <!DOCTYPE > is not a tag/element, it just an instruction
    to the browser about the document type. It is a null element which does 
    not contain the closing tag, and must not include any content within it. 
  =>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers Document Type Declaration (DTD) in HTML 4.01;
    because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML.
